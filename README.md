# sync-timer

Minimal self-hostable browser synchronization timer that slowly corrects errors over time, inspired by https://time.curby.net/clock. Written to be captured as a browser source in [OBS Studio](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio) in live stream production, so no styling beyond the font to reduce rendering work.

https://sync.noglitchesallowed.org for a public instance.

# Install & run

```
git clone https://github.com/noglitchesallowed/sync-timer

```

View at http://localhost:3000. Port can be changed in config/ if needed.
